# About the website

Bookchain is a book-sharing platform or a dynamic library. Users can post their own books and get in contact with other owners, so that they can arrange a meeting and get the titles they are interested in. But the catch is, once uploaded on the site, the books will travel from one person to another, never having just one owner.
